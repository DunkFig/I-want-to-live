		<div>Hello, they gave me your number. They say that you can surrender voluntarily, yes? I'm in the Kherson direction.</div>
		<div>The thing is that they take their phones away. </div>
		<div>As soon as your son ends up in Territory under Ukrainian Control he should immediately contact us. 
</div>
		<div>He was handed it, handed it at the road by the police station</div>
		<div>Did he accept the Summons?
</div>
		<div>By any convenient method.
</div>
		<div>Just to get in touch - to make one call. 
</div>
		<div>We’ll recieve him safe and sound.
</div>
		<div>We’ll fill in his contact details and provide a location for safe exit
</div>

</div>
		<div>I see. Which number should he call?</div>

		<div>Three communication methods. 
</div>

</div>
		<div>I’m a civilian. I want to become a citizen of Ukraine. I want all of this to end as soon as possible. </div>
		<div>When you are on the front line call us here again. 
</div>
